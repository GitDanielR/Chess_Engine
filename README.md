# Chess_Engine
My chess engine in Python using pygame once again. This is a very rough draft and I am sure that the way I represent a board is bad but I made a class for
chess pieces and there's no going back now. 

Features:
* knows whose move it is
* allows for taking

Improvements:
* need to add legal moves
* make a chess bot
